def schedule_check_in(event, context):
    """
    This function serves two purposes:

        1) For new executions, it looks up the reservation via the Southwest
           API and returns the check-in times (described below).

        2) In the event there are multiple check-ins, this function is called
           again by the AWS Step state machine to schedule the next available
           check-in time. It does this by popping a value from
           `check_in_times.remaining` into `check_in_times.next`.

    Returns a dictionary of the next and remaining check-in times in RFC 3339
    format. Ex:

        {
            "check_in_times": {
                "next": "2017-05-06T20:40:00-04:00",
                "remaining": [
                    "2017-05-12T20:40:00-04:00",
                    "2017-05-09T20:40:00-04:00"
